# react-experimential-custom

This is a custom build of React, that enable some more extras APIs we need for Ladifire development projects.

e.g:
* ```React.unstable_Scope```
* ```React.unstable_DebugTracingMode```
* ```React.unstable_LegacyHidden```
* ```React.unstable_SuspenseList```
* ```React.unstable_useTransition```
* ```React.unstable_startTransition```
* ```React.jsxs```
* ```React.jsx```
* ```React.jsxDEV```

# How to use?

This is React, maybe equivalent to ```React experimental build```.

If you want to use, try ```yarn link``` to use.
